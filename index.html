        <h3>Kniraven's Blog</h3>
        <article class="personal school">
            <h4>Monday, April 22nd 2019</h4>
            <p>It is 5:25pm CST. I just got done reading
            <a href="https://stanfordmag.org/contents/the-effort-effect" target="_blank">The&nbsp;Effort&nbsp;Effect</a>
            in Stanford Magazine. It was assigned by my <strong>Intro to Databases</strong>
            professor as extra credit. It speaks on the difference in mentality
            between people who view setbacks as a lack of effort on their part
            vs those who view them as a lack of static personal ability.</p>
            <p>For the most part, I feel like the sort of person who views
            setbacks as a personal lacking of effort. However, according to the
            article I do have one tendency indicative of the other category. I
            feel threatened by the success of others. I don't feel literally
            threatened, but I feel jealousy and a drive to surpass them. I need
            to think about those feelings and whether or not they're healthy.</p>
            <p>It is 6:30pm CST. Right now I am in Java class. We are learning
            about Static Methods/Variables and about Final variables (constants).
            My professor, Randy Bielby, is showing us a demo utilizing different
            sided dice as an example. He asked the class <em>"I think D&D uses dice.
            Anybody know how many sides D&D dice have?"</em> HA! I went off immediately
            listing all of the dice.</p>
            <p>Shout out to Martin Rivera, his next example involved counting
            ducks. Lol</p>
            <p>I also learned about default constructors (no arg constructors).
            I am about to head out now. I still need to complete a test for
            Intro to Database and complete the extra credit assignment.</p>

          <h4>Sunday, April 21st 2019</h4>
          <p>No work to the site was done today. This is more of a personal
          journal entry.</p>
          <p>I did my MATC homework today. Advanced Web Design homework today
          involves Grid view with floats. This seems significantly worse than
          flex-box. That is what I am learning in that class this week.<br />
          For Java, I completed my work in class last monday. It is an exercise
          in using sub-classes and abstract methods.<br />
          I haven't yet looked at or worked on my Intro to Database homework
          which is due tomorrow at midnight. I plan to get a start on that after
          I am done writing this.</p>
          <p>So... Game of Thrones, Season 8, Episode 2 just happened.<br />
          It felt a little wrong seeing Masie Williams breasts. I predict Jamie,
          Grey Wurm, and Daenerys are all going to die.</p>

        <article class="update">
          <h4>Saturday, April 20th 2019</h4>
          <p>Today I added all my social media buttons.<br />
          In addition, I've placed large button links to my D&D campaign
          sub-sites on the homepage.</p>
          <p>So far, sub-sites will be for:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Wishes of Nibiru <span>Modern DS & 5E campaign</span></li>
              <li>Deadly Destined <span>5E Campaign I participate in</span></li>
              <li>Daymond Sky <span>A build of the lore and system</span></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Kniraven is currently in the process of rebuilding this site.
          Completion is estimated to occur by July 22, 2019.</p>
